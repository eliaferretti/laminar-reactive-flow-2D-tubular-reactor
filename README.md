# laminar-reactive-flow-2D-tubular-reactor

Simulation of a 2D tubular reactor:

The presented simulation is based on an explicit Operator-Splitting scheme for integration of the species transport equations, projection algorithm scheme for
Navier-Stokes equation using a IIâ€™in differencing scheme for first order spatial derivatives (https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/91/3/557/639367),
centered second order accurate  differencing scheme for second order spatial derivatives and an explicit first order accurate differencing scheme for time discretization. 
Finite volume formulation of the governing equations is used.
